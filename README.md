## work given to us by our ICT instructor, Samuel Oladokun

- Open the entire repository on your text editor (I used *Visual Studio Code*)
  - Launch **hangman.php** on your browser
  - Have internet connection so some Font Awesome icons can load properly
  - Navigate your way around and enjoy
- Have XAMPP or MAMP running on your local computer for the PP side of the project (I used *XAMPP*)
- View results on your browser (I used *Google Chrome*)

Thank you.
